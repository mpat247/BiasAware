# BiasAware - Technical Project Overview

## üéØ Project Summary

**BiasAware** is an end-to-end research platform that exposes and quantifies social biases in AI text-to-image generation models. The system combines AI model evaluation, statistical analysis, and interactive visualization to demonstrate how modern image generators perpetuate harmful biases across demographics.

**Key Achievement**: Generated and analyzed 3,300+ images across 11 bias categories, revealing significant demographic skews in AI-generated content.

## üìä Research Methodology

### Bias Categories Evaluated

1. **Activities** - Sports, hobbies, recreational activities
2. **Addictions** - Substance use representations
3. **Crime** - Criminal activity depictions
4. **Emotions** - Emotional expression patterns
5. **Quality of Life** - Lifestyle and socioeconomic indicators
6. **Professions** - Career representations across domains
7. **Engineering** - Technical field representations
8. **Neighborhoods** - Geographic and socioeconomic bias

### Data Collection Process

1. **Prompt Generation**: 150 variations per category (3,300 total prompts)
2. **Image Generation**: Used Stable Diffusion and NightCafe platforms
3. **Manual Annotation**: Categorized by race, gender, and age demographics
4. **Statistical Analysis**: Calculated percentage distributions and bias patterns
5. **Custom Model Training**: Fine-tuned Stable Diffusion on Toronto neighborhood data

## üîç Key Findings

| Bias Category    | Primary Gender Bias | Primary Race Bias | Age Bias    |
| ---------------- | ------------------- | ----------------- | ----------- |
| Activities       | Male (65%)          | White (70%)       | Adult (83%) |
| Crime            | Male (78%)          | Racialized (60%)  | Adult (90%) |
| Healthcare Prof. | Female (62%)        | White (55%)       | Adult (88%) |
| Engineering      | Male (82%)          | Mixed             | Adult (95%) |
